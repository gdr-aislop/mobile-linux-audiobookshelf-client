# Build environment for scripts/build-appimage.sh (Debian bookworm).
#
# Used by scripts/build-appimage-in-docker.sh so local builds happen against
# the same library baseline as the CI builds (.github/workflows/release.yml,
# which runs the same apt install inside a debian:bookworm container job) and
# therefore against the same library versions as the target distros
# (PureOS Crimson, Ubuntu 24.04).

# libsoup-3.0-0 must be explicit: gstreamer1.0-plugins-good depends on
# "libsoup2.4-1 OR libsoup-3.0-0", and apt happily satisfies that with soup2 —
# leaving no libsoup-3 for GStreamer's soup plugin to dlopen at runtime, which
# kills all https:// playback in the produced AppImage.
