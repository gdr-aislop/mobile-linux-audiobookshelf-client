# Audiobooklet

A client for [Audiobookshelf](https://audiobookshelf.org/) servers, for Librem 5 / Phosh.
Offline-first, fast Rust native code, installable on PureOS Crimson as a deb.
For other Linux phones, Appimage and Flatpak builds are available.

## Features

*Offline-First* - first-class support for downloading audiobooks to local
storage, syncing progress after listening offline. Has both manually enabled
offline mode and network loss detection.

*Phone, not Gnome* - a mobile app, not a responsive desktop program. Pause
on call, handle headphones unplugging, battery efficiency, playback
notification. Tested on a real, slow phone.

*Comfortable* - has playback speed, sleep timer, fast forward/rewind, search
and filtering.

*Free Software* - GPLv3 licensed, only makes network calls to your Audiobookshelf
server

Audiobooklet is an independent project, not affiliated with the Audiobookshelf project.

## Installing

### Upgrading from abs-app

Up to 0.9.5 the app was called `abs-app` (shown as "Audiobookshelf"); it is now Audiobooklet, with
the app ID `io.github.gdr_aislop.audiobooklet` and a new repository URL.

- **.deb:** remove the old APT source (`sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/abs-app.list
  /etc/apt/keyrings/abs-app.asc`), add the new one below, then `sudo apt install audiobooklet`,
  which replaces the `abs-app` package.
- **Your data:** on its first start Audiobooklet moves the old `io.github.gdr_aislop.abs-app`
  folders (login, settings, downloads) to its own, and keeps a remembered password.
- **Flatpak:** the new app ID makes it a separate app: install Audiobooklet, then
  `flatpak uninstall io.github.gdr_aislop.abs-app`. Flatpak data doesn't carry over.

### Installing the Flatpak

The recommended way — adds a remote once, then `flatpak update` picks up
every new tagged release automatically:

```sh
flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists audiobooklet \
  https://gdr-aislop.github.io/audiobooklet/io.github.gdr_aislop.audiobooklet.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user audiobooklet io.github.gdr_aislop.audiobooklet
```

Alternatively, download the `.flatpak` file from a
[release](../../releases) and install it directly, with no remote added:

```sh
flatpak install --user ./audiobooklet-<version>-<arch>.flatpak
```

### Installing the .deb via APT

The recommended way — adds the repo once, then `apt upgrade` picks up every
new tagged release automatically (arm64 and amd64 only):

```sh
sudo curl -fsSL https://gdr-aislop.github.io/audiobooklet/apt/audiobooklet.asc \
  -o /etc/apt/keyrings/audiobooklet.asc
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/audiobooklet.asc] https://gdr-aislop.github.io/audiobooklet/apt stable main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/audiobooklet.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install audiobooklet
```

This repo always carries the *latest* tagged release only (not a full
version history) — older `.deb`s stay available from
[past releases](../../releases) directly, via `sudo apt install
./audiobooklet_<version>_<arch>.deb`.

### Verifying a standalone `.deb` or `.AppImage`

Every `.deb` and `.AppImage` attached to a [release](../../releases) also
gets a detached signature (`<file>.asc`), from the same key that signs the
Flatpak and APT repos — useful if you downloaded one directly rather than
through either repo (an `apt install` from the hosted repo above is already
verified via its own signed `Release`/`InRelease`, with nothing extra to do):

```sh
gpg --import audiobooklet-signing-key.asc   # once, also attached to every release
gpg --verify audiobooklet_<version>_<arch>.deb.asc audiobooklet_<version>_<arch>.deb
gpg --verify audiobooklet-<version>-<arch>.AppImage.asc audiobooklet-<version>-<arch>.AppImage
```

The signing key's fingerprint is:

```
CC77 E444 A5CD 5384 0459  1237 08D0 546C 9455 D910
```

Check it against `gpg --fingerprint` after importing `audiobooklet-signing-key.asc`, since that
file is hosted alongside the binaries it verifies and shouldn't be the only
source trusted for the key itself.

### Building an AppImage manually

```sh
# Inside a Debian-family system with the dev + runtime packages installed:
./scripts/build-appimage.sh                       # x86_64, version from git
./scripts/build-appimage.sh --arch aarch64 --version 0.1.0

# Anywhere, via a Debian bookworm container (docker or podman):
./scripts/build-appimage-in-docker.sh

# aarch64 AppImage on an x86_64 host (arm64 container under QEMU emulation):
./scripts/build-aarch64-appimage-on-x86.sh
```

Output lands in `build/appimage/audiobooklet-<version>-<arch>.AppImage`.
`scripts/build-appimage.sh --help` documents environment overrides
(`ABS_APP_BIN`, `LINUXDEPLOY`, `APPIMAGE_TOOLS_DIR`); the docker wrapper
mirrors the CI job's package set via `scripts/appimage-builder-bookworm.Dockerfile`.

## Translations

The interface is translatable with gettext and available in English and Polish. It follows the
system language by default; Settings → Appearance → Language overrides that. Improving a
translation or adding a language is a `po/<lang>.po` file (Polish: [`po/pl.po`](po/pl.po)); see
[docs/i18n.md](docs/i18n.md) for how to extract, translate and test strings.

## Reporting problems

When reporting a bug, attach the contents of `~/.local/state/io.github.gdr_aislop.audiobooklet/`:

- `logs/audiobooklet.*` (Settings → Diagnostics → "Open latest log file" opens the
  newest one) — a rotating, human-readable log file (last 7 days kept).
  A Rust panic always logs its full backtrace here, even without
  `RUST_BACKTRACE` set. By default the log is anonymized: server addresses,
  URLs, usernames, access tokens and your home directory are replaced with
  placeholders such as `<url>`, `<server>` and `<user>`, so it is safe to
  attach. Settings → Diagnostics → "Anonymize logs" turns this off, which is
  only useful while debugging a connection problem yourself. (Crash dumps
  below are not anonymized; they contain no log text but can include memory
  contents.)
- `crashes/crash-<timestamp>-<pid>.dmp` — a Breakpad-format minidump written
  for a native (signal-level) crash a Rust panic hook can't catch (a
  segfault/abort inside GTK/GStreamer/glib). It's binary, not directly
  readable: turn it into a stack trace with
  [`minidump-stackwalk`](https://crates.io/crates/minidump-stackwalk)
  (`cargo install minidump-stackwalk`), which also needs debug symbols from
  a build matching the exact version that crashed (an unstripped binary, or
  a separately retained `.debug` file).
