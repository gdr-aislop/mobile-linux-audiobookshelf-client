//! The post-login shell: a 4-destination bottom tab bar (Home / Library / Downloads / Settings),
//! per `docs/design/ui-spec.md` §2's phone-width navigation model. Built from `AdwViewStack` +
//! `AdwViewSwitcherBar` — both available at this crate's libadwaita `v1_2` ceiling (confirmed by
//! reading `libadwaita-0.7.2/src/auto/mod.rs`'s cfg gates: neither is behind a version feature
//! gate, unlike `AdwToolbarView`/`AdwBreakpoint`/`AdwNavigationView`/`AdwNavigationSplitView`,
//! which are all `v1_4` and out of reach here) — so, unlike the mini-player bar or the Welcome
//! screen's auth-mode toggle, this needs no hand-rolled compatibility widget.
//!
//! Only Home has real content so far; Library/Downloads/Settings are `AdwStatusPage` stubs, each
//! still a real page in the stack so wiring in an actual screen later is a one-line swap. No
//! wide-screen sidebar layout (`AdwNavigationSplitView`/`AdwBreakpoint`, both v1.4+) — phone-width
//! single-pane only, left as a documented follow-up.
