//! The Library tab's content — a searchable/sortable grid of every item across every synced
//! library, per `docs/design/ui-spec.md`'s "Library browse" section. Unlike Home's two curated
//! 10-item shelves, this shows everything.
//!
//! Category chips (All/Author/Series/Genre) and the view-options popover (Downloaded only/In
//! progress only/Hide finished/Grouping/Sort by/Application settings) both read and write
//! `abs_core::settings::LibraryViewOptions` — persisted, unlike the search box, which stays
//! session-only (see below). This popover used to coexist with an older "Sort & filter" popover;
//! that one has been folded into this sheet entirely (its two options with no equivalent here —
//! "In progress only" and a "Last listened" sort — were moved over, everything else already had
//! one) rather than kept as a second control. Grouped section headers (by author or series) are
//! *grouped*, not *sticky*: true sticky-while-scrolling headers need a `GtkListView`/`GListModel`-
//! bound render model, which this screen doesn't use anywhere (every render fully rebuilds
//! `flow_box`/`list_box` from scratch) — a documented simplification, not attempted here. Search
//! and sort are client-side over the already-synced local table — neither `abs-storage` nor the
//! real Audiobookshelf API surface this client uses expose search/sort/pagination query params,
//! so there is nothing server-side to delegate to yet.
//!
//! The grid/list choice is persisted via `abs_core::settings::{load,save}_library_view_mode` (a
//! plain key/value setting, same pattern as every other typed setting in that module) — restored
//! at startup and re-saved whenever the header's view toggle changes. Search text is session-only,
//! not persisted — the ui-spec doesn't ask for that, and a stale search filter silently narrowing
//! a freshly-opened Library screen would be a surprise, not a convenience. `apply_view` (Home's
//! Continue Listening tap-through) is likewise deliberately session-only even though it writes the
//! same `sort`/`in_progress_only` Cells the sheet's own persisted controls do — a temporary
//! navigation view, not the user setting a lasting preference.
//!
//! Search is debounced (`search_debounce` in `build()`) rather than re-rendering on every raw
//! `search-changed` emission, and every render's cards are built with their cover decode
//! deferred (`item_card::build_deferred`/`library_list_row_deferred`) rather than eager — only
//! covers within (or near) the scrolled viewport actually decode, tracked via `pending_covers`
//! and `decode_covers_in_viewport`, on scroll as well as right after a render. Both exist to fix
//! a reported freeze: typing used to re-render (and thus redecode every visible cover from disk,
//! synchronously) on every keystroke. `widgets::cover_image::CoverImage` itself now also decodes
//! asynchronously and caches decoded textures — see that module's doc comment for the rest of the
//! fix; this screen's half is just "don't ask for a cover before it's actually about to be seen."
