//! A small reusable widget for a cover-art slot that starts as a plain placeholder and swaps to
//! the real image once one is cached locally (`abs_core::covers::fetch_and_cache_cover`). Not a
//! libadwaita compatibility shim like this module's other widgets — just a graceful-degradation
//! wrapper: a missing or corrupt cached file must never be treated as an error, only as "show the
//! placeholder", since cover art is cosmetic and this codebase already shows a plain placeholder
//! card everywhere covers aren't available yet.
//!
//! Decoding is asynchronous and cached process-wide. Library's search (and, more generally, any
//! screen that rebuilds many cards on every render/scroll) used to redecode every visible cover
//! from disk synchronously on the GTK main thread on every keystroke — the actual cause of a
//! reported multi-second UI freeze while typing. `set_path` now checks a shared, byte-budgeted
//! LRU texture cache first; on a miss it shows the placeholder immediately and decodes on a
//! background thread (`tokio::task::spawn_blocking`, resumed on the main thread once done via
//! `glib::spawn_future_local` — the same "start on the main loop, await a tokio-spawned task"
//! idiom `screens::library`'s own sync pipeline already uses), so a cache miss never blocks.
//!
//! The decode target is the widget's *physical* pixel size (`size` scaled by the surface's
//! `scale-factor`), not just its logical `size` — decoding at logical size only and letting a
//! HiDPI/scaled output (e.g. a phosh integer-scaled display) stretch it to fill the physical
//! surface blurs every cover uniformly, regardless of how small the slot is. See
//! `CoverImage::decode_pixels`.
