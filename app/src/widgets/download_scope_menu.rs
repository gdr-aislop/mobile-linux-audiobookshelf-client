//! The shared "Download" scope-picker button — `docs/design/ui-spec.md`'s Item Detail "Download
//! options (Lissen-style)" bottom sheet, approximated as a `GtkMenuButton` + `GtkPopover` at this
//! crate's libadwaita `v1_2` ceiling (`AdwBottomSheet` needs 1.6) — same convention every other
//! popover in this crate already uses instead of `GMenu`/`GAction`.
//!
//! Extracted out of `screens::player` (see its git history) once `screens::item_detail` needed the
//! *identical* behavior: both screens need a user to be able to pick "Current chapter"/"Next
//! chapters" (with its stepper)/"Remaining chapters"/"Entire book", see live size estimates and a
//! free-space guard, and clear whatever's already downloaded — one definition, not two copies that
//! could quietly drift apart. Both call sites build one of these and embed `.widget` directly in
//! their own header/actions row, the same "shared building block" shape `widgets::cover_image` and
//! `widgets::item_card` already are.
//!
//! Never imports `abs_api` directly: chapters are taken as plain `(start_seconds, end_seconds)`
//! pairs rather than `abs_api::ChapterRef` — same boundary `abs_core::download_tracks`'s own
//! `estimate_bytes_for_chapters`/`chapter_offline_markers_for_item` already draw for exactly this
//! reason.
