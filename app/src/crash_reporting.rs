//! Local-only (never phones home) crash observability: a persistent, rotating log file under
//! `AppPaths::logs_dir()`, a panic hook that always captures a full backtrace (no
//! `RUST_BACKTRACE` needed), and local Breakpad-format `.dmp` files for native (signal-level)
//! crashes — a segfault/abort inside the GTK/GStreamer/glib C code this binary links against,
//! which a Rust panic hook can never catch. All of this exists because a deployed build normally
//! has no terminal attached (a phone running Phosh) — without it, a crash today leaves no trace a
//! user could ever hand back in a bug report.
//!
//! Ordinary logging deliberately avoids touching flash on every event: writes accumulate in an
//! in-memory buffer and only reach disk on a coarse periodic timer, on a panic, or on clean
//! shutdown — see [`BufferedLogWriter`].
//!
//! Native crash dumps use an out-of-process design (`crash-handler` + `minidumper`, Embark
//! Studios; local IPC + local file only, never networked): this binary re-execs itself as a tiny
//! crash-server subprocess (see [`crash_server_socket_name`]/[`run_crash_server`]) that receives
//! a crash report over a Unix domain socket and writes the `.dmp` file — safer than writing one
//! from inside the crashing process's own signal handler, where very few operations are actually
//! safe to perform.
