//! Bridges `abs-player`'s poll-based `AudioBackend` to GTK widgets: a mini-player bar (built here,
//! always present in `main_window` once something has played) and, optionally, a full player
//! screen's widgets (`screens::player`). This module — not `abs_core::playback::PlaybackState` —
//! is what actually drives real playback.
//!
//! `PlaybackState` is a simulated tick-based clock (`position += elapsed * speed`) with no method
//! to feed it an authoritative position from a real backend and no reference to `abs_player`
//! anywhere in `abs-core` (by design — `abs-core` has zero GStreamer dependency). Wiring a real
//! GStreamer pipeline's displayed position to that simulated clock would let the two drift apart,
//! which is a correctness bug, not an architecture shortcut — so this controller polls
//! `AudioBackend` directly instead, and `PlaybackState` stays unused. Don't "helpfully" reconnect
//! them without first giving `PlaybackState` a real way to reconcile with actual backend state.
//!
//! Never imports `abs_api`: the only network call this makes is
//! `abs_core::streaming::resolve_stream_target`, which builds its own authenticated
//! `abs_api::Client` internally — same boundary every other screen already respects.
