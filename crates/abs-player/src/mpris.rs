//! MPRIS2 (`org.mpris.MediaPlayer2`) system media integration —
//! `docs/design/ui-spec.md`'s "System media integration" section. This lives in `abs-player`
//! rather than `app` because it's real OS I/O (a D-Bus session), the same category this crate
//! already owns for GStreamer — not a GTK widget-toolkit concern. `gio`/`glib` are direct
//! dependencies here (already present transitively via `gtk4`/`adw`), not `zbus`: no new external
//! crate, and object registration is exactly `gio::DBusConnection`'s own API.
//!
//! This module never imports anything from `app` — [`register`] takes a plain trait object
//! (`Rc<dyn MprisCommands>`) supplied by the caller and calls back into it; `app/src/player.rs`
//! is the only place that ties `MprisCommands` to a real `PlayerController`. That's the whole
//! dependency-direction story: `app` depends on `abs-player`, never the reverse.
//!
//! `Next`/`Previous` go to the next/previous chapter, never a literal track change (this app has
//! no playlist concept) — the system media card already has its own seek buttons for skipping.
//! A book without chapters falls back to skip-forward/back-N-seconds, per
//! `docs/design/ui-spec.md`'s mapping. Which of the two happens is the caller's business.
