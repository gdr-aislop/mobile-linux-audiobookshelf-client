//! Headphone plug/unplug watching — `docs/design/ui-spec.md`'s "Hardware controls & interruptions":
//! pause playback when the audio output the listener is wearing goes away (wired jack unplugged,
//! Bluetooth headphones disconnected), and optionally resume when it comes back. Lives in
//! `abs-player` for the same reason `mpris` and `call_watch` do — this is real OS audio-server
//! integration, not a GTK widget-toolkit concern.
//!
//! MPRIS can't do any of this: it is an outbound-only control interface (it exposes this app's
//! player state and accepts transport commands from the shell), with no concept of inbound
//! audio-routing events. The routing authority is the audio server — PulseAudio, or PipeWire
//! via its `pipewire-pulse` compatibility socket (the standard mobile-Linux setup) — which
//! reports kernel jack detection as a *port availability* flag on the sink's ports. This module
//! watches that over the PulseAudio client protocol (the same libpulse GStreamer's `pulsesink`
//! — the audio path this app actually plays through — already uses), so it sees both wired jack
//! events and Bluetooth sink appearances/disappearances with one integration.
//!
//! Port availability is tracked **per sink** and the events describe the aggregate — "is any
//! headphone output still available?" — because more than one sink can carry a headphone-ish
//! port at once: PulseAudio's Bluetooth sinks have `headphone-output` / `headset-output` ports
//! whose availability follows the A2DP/HFP transport state (yes while streaming, unknown while
//! idle, no while disconnected) alongside the wired card's `[Out] Headphones` / `analog-output-
//! headphones` port. Feeding those readings into one shared state would flip-flop on every
//! rescan (a volume change is enough to trigger one) and pause playback for no reason; and a
//! wired unplug while Bluetooth headphones are still streaming is not an "output went away".
//!
//! Two known limits, both documented in the spec: a Bluetooth disconnect shows up as the whole
//! sink being removed (always detectable), while a wired unplug needs the hardware to report jack
//! detection — devices whose port reports "unknown" availability (some USB DACs) can't be
//! detected and are ignored. And like `call_watch`, there is deliberately no unconditional
//! auto-resume: resuming after a replug only ever happens when the preceding pause was itself
//! caused by an unplug (see `PlayerController::handle_route_event`), so a manual pause or a
//! phone call is never overridden by a reconnection.
//!
//! The connection to the audio server is kept for the app's lifetime: if it drops (PulseAudio
//! restarted or crashed, which on a phone that suspends/resumes for days is a real possibility),
//! the watcher reconnects with backoff and starts observing from scratch — only the *first*
//! connection attempt is allowed to fail `new()`, so an environment with no audio server at all
//! still degrades gracefully.
//!
//! Delivered events:
//! - [`RouteEvent::Unplugged`] — the headphone port flipped from available to unavailable, or
//!   the sink we were listening on disappeared (Bluetooth).
//! - [`RouteEvent::Replugged`] — a headphone port became available again. Harmless if nothing
//!   had been unplugged: consumers gate on "did we auto-pause".
