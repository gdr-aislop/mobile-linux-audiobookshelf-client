//! Keeps a stored account's access token working across launches and across a long session.
//! Audiobookshelf servers from v2.26.0 on issue short-lived JWT access tokens (1–12 hours
//! depending on version/settings) paired with a long-lived refresh token that **rotates on every
//! use** — so a client like this one, which persists tokens across runs and can sit open for
//! hours, must: notice an expiring access token, exchange the refresh token at
//! `POST /auth/refresh`, and persist the rotated pair. Skipping this is exactly the "logged out
//! in ~an hour" behavior this module exists to prevent (observed live: login at ~18:05, every
//! API call 401 by 19:03).
//!
//! Layering: [`Session`] lives in `abs-core` because it is domain logic (DB + HTTP, no widgets);
//! it depends only on `abs-storage` and `abs-api`. The `app` crate constructs one per login and
//! hands it to screens, which ask it for a token at *call* time instead of capturing
//! `account.token` once at build time — the capture-once pattern is what let tokens die
//! mid-session. Everything is deliberately best-effort in the same posture as
//! `covers`/`progress_sync`: if a refresh can't be attempted (legacy server, no refresh token)
//! or fails (server down, session revoked), the current token is returned and the failure is
//! only logged — the next 401 is no worse than what would happen without this module.
//!
//! The one failure that isn't harmless is a refresh the server acted on whose reply never
//! arrived: the server has swapped the pair, and this client still holds the refresh token it
//! replaced. The server keeps accepting that old token for a grace window (10 minutes by
//! default) and answers it with the new pair; after that, the login is gone for good (observed
//! live: a reply cut off at 15:45, the next attempt at 19:32 rejected, signed out). So a refresh
//! that may have been acted on is retried in the background until it's confirmed, inside that
//! window, and the device is kept awake meanwhile so a sleeping phone doesn't let it pass.
//!
//! When the server does reject the refresh token for good (that window missed, the token's
//! 30-day lifetime run out, the server's sessions lost), the session signs in again with the
//! account's remembered password, if there is one (see [`crate::passwords`]), so one sign-in lasts
//! however long the app goes unused. A password the server rejects isn't tried again until the
//! user signs in by hand.
