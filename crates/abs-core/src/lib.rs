//! UI-agnostic domain logic: authentication, multi-server/account management, library sync,
//! download-scope resolution, the playback state machine, and typed settings. Depends on
//! `abs-api` and `abs-storage`; never depends on GTK or GStreamer, which is what makes it
//! unit-testable without a display or audio hardware — see each module's tests.
